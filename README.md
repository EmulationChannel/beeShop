# beeShop
AutoHotkey Script that downloads 3DS game files from a database, and copies them over to a 3DS via FTP.

## How to use:

1. Download & extract the latest beeShop release.
2. Open FBI on your 3DS and note down the IP.
3. Open beeShop.exe, and click on "Settings" which should open a text file, write down your IP there (example: `192.168.1.36`), save the file, and close it.
4. Select game from the list of the available ones, and click "Bump".

beeShop should now start downloading the game file.
